<p>Full featured CreateJS game example.</p>
<p>Important notes: - due to security restrictions on local content, you must run this example from a web server. - iOS Safari has a major bug which currently results in very poor performance. Apple has been made aware of this issue, and I am attempting to isolate it.</p>
<p>Demonstrates a variety of advanced concepts including: - preloading with progress UI &amp; multiple parallel loads - using an external manifest to load sounds - managing assets as they load - ex1. music plays as soon as it finishes loading - ex2. sprite sheet builder runs as soon as all dependencies are loaded - asynchronous run-time sprite sheet generation - all art is loaded as vector which allows scaling and keeps file size low - to show scaling, load the game with a “scale” querystring param: /index.html?scale=0.3 - over-the-wire (gzipped) art size is only ~85kb vs ~3MB for sprite sheets - sprite sheet is generated while other assets load - dynamic sound effects (reverb effect when clicking Start Game) - SpriteStage and SpriteContainer using WebGL for game rendering - state changes - DOMElement for the score board - tweening music volume</p>
<p>All art &amp; graphics is copyright 2013 gskinner.com, inc. and cannot be used without permission.</p>
<p>I will likely write up more information on how different parts of this example works when time permits. Keep an eye on this repo, and the CreateJS blog for updates (blog.createjs.com).</p>
