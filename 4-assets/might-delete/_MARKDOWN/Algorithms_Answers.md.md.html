<h2 id="exercise-i">Exercise I</h2>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>O(n) because n is the difference between the powers n^2 (worth of each step) and n^3 (max)</p></li>
<li><p>O(n^2) because there are two nested loops</p></li>
<li><p>O(n) because it is recursive</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="exercise-ii">Exercise II</h2>
<ul>
<li>loop through 0 to n-1 to represent each story</li>
<li>you will not actually loop through every story, only up to where the eggs start breaking</li>
<li>try to drop an egg off of each floor</li>
<li>if it is successful (no breakage), go to next floor</li>
<li>if egg breaks, save current story as variable and exit loop</li>
<li>subtract 1 from current story</li>
<li>return story</li>
<li><p>The runtime of this would be O(n) because there is one loop and it is dependent on the number of building stories.</p></li>
<li>Alternatively, you could do a binary search, start at n/2 and then do upper or lower half depending on if it breaks or not until you get the max floor.</li>
<li><p>This would be runtime O(log n).</p></li>
</ul>
