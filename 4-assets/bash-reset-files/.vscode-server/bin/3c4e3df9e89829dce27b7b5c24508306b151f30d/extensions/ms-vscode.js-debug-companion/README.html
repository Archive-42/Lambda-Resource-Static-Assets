<h1 id="js-debug-companion">js-debug-companion</h1>
<p>A companion extension to <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug">js-debug</a> to enable remote Chrome debugging. You probably don’t want to install this extension by itself, but for your interest, this is what it does.</p>
<p>The scenario is if you are developing in a remote environment—like WSL, a container, ssh, or <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-codespaces/">VS Codespaces</a>—and are port-forwarding a server to develop (and debug) in a browser locally. For remote development, VS Code runs two sets of extensions: one on the remote machine, and one on your local computer. <code>js-debug</code> is a “workspace” extension that runs on the remote machine, but we need to launch and talk to Chrome locally.</p>
<p>That’s where this companion extension comes in. This helper extension runs on the local machine (in the “UI”) and registers a command that <code>js-debug</code> can call to launch a server. <code>js-debug</code> requests a port to be forwarded for debug traffic, and once launching a browser the companion will connect to and forward traffic over that socket.</p>
