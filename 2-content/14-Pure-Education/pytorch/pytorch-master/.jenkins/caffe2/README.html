<p>The scripts in this directory are the entrypoint for testing Caffe2.</p>
<p>The environment variable <code>BUILD_ENVIRONMENT</code> is expected to be set to the build environment you intend to test. It is a hint for the build and test scripts to configure Caffe2 a certain way and include/exclude tests. Docker images, they equal the name of the image itself. For example: <code>py2-cuda9.0-cudnn7-ubuntu16.04</code>. The Docker images that are built on Jenkins and are used in triggered builds already have this environment variable set in their manifest. Also see <code>./docker/jenkins/*/Dockerfile</code> and search for <code>BUILD_ENVIRONMENT</code>.</p>
<p>Our Jenkins installation is located at https://ci.pytorch.org/jenkins/.</p>
