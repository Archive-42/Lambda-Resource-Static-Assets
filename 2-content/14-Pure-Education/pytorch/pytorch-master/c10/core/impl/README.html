<p>c10/core/impl provides headers for functionality that is only needed in very <em>specific</em> use-cases (e.g., you are defining a new device type), which are generally only needed by C10 or PyTorch code. If you are an ordinary end-user, you <strong>should not</strong> use headers in this folder. We permanently give NO backwards-compatibility guarantees for implementations in this folder.</p>
<p>Compare with <a href="c10/util">c10/util</a>, which provides functionality that is not directly related to being a deep learning library (e.g., C++20 polyfills), but may still be generally useful and visible to users.</p>
<p>(We donâ€™t call this c10/detail, because the detail namespace convention is for <em>header private</em> details. However, c10::impl may be utilized from external headers; it simply indicates that the functionality is not for end users.)</p>
