<p>The pricing and distribution tab lets you control how you charge for your item and who will see it on the Chrome Web Store.</p>

<h2 id="setting-the-visibility-setting-the-visibility">Setting the visibility {: #setting-the-visibility }</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>Visibility</strong> settings to configure who can see your item in the Chrome Web Store:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public</strong>—This option lists your item on the Chrome Web Store for all users to see and install.</li>
<li><strong>Unlisted</strong>—This option does not create a listing on the Chrome Web Store, but does allows anyone to install your item if they know its Chrome Web Store URL.</li>
<li><strong>Private</strong>—This option limits installation of your item to specified users only. This is typically used for testing before public launch of an item.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="private-visibility-trusted-testers-private-visibility-trusted-testers">Private visibility: Trusted testers {: #private-visibility-trusted-testers }</h3>
<p>Private allows your trusted testers to install the item. You designate trusted testers by listing them on your Chrome Web Store account home page.</p>
<p>{% Aside %}</p>
<p>The trusted testers list is associated with your <em>account</em>, and not an individual item. To create multiple trusted tester accounts, you must use separate accounts. However, you can also <a href="#private-visibility-groups">add groups</a>to your private listing, on a per-item basis.</p>
<p>{% endAside %}</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows some trusted tester accounts listed in a Chrome Web Store developer account page:</p>

<h3 id="private-visibility-google-groups-private-visibility-google-groups">Private visibility: Google Groups {: #private-visibility-google-groups }</h3>
<p>In addition to your trusted tester accounts, you can also include any Google Groups that you own or manage:</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/oTlA3I2z8qNRiqSj9T2j.png”, alt=“Screenshot showing groups added to private visibility”, height=“520”, width=“800” %}</p>
<p>Any members of the specified groups, along with your trusted testers, will be able to install the item.</p>
<h2 id="setting-the-geographic-distribution-setting-the-geographic-distribution">Setting the geographic distribution {: #setting-the-geographic-distribution }</h2>
<p>The <strong>Distribution</strong> setting lets you specify which geographic areas will see your item listing in the Chrome Web Store. You can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select <strong>All regions</strong> to display your item to the entire world.</li>
<li>Select individual countries to publish to—this is useful for items with a regional focus or relevance.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you publish to the world, your item will be immediately visible to the region(s) you select, and it’ll be visible in the store’s search results.</p>
