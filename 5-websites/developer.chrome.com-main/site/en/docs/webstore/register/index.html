<p>Before you can publish items on the Chrome Web Store, you must register as a CWS developer and pay a one-time registration fee. You must provide a developer email when you create your developer account; here are some tips about which email to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s a good idea to decouple your personal account and your Chrome Web Store publishing account. That’s why we suggest using a new email account just for publishing your Chrome Web Store items.</li>
<li>If you recently deleted your Chrome Web Store developer account, you can’t reuse its associated email identity to create a new one. {% Aside ‘warning’ %} If you requested the deletion of your account by mistake, please contact developer support immediately. {% endAside %}</li>
<li>Make sure to check this address frequently so that you’re aware of any important alerts or announcements.</li>
</ul>
<p>To register, just access the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole">developer console</a>. The first time you do this, a registration screen appears as shown here:</p>
<p>{% Img src=“image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/adH2VFqS92VdzPTjsHtB.png”, alt=“Screenshot of the Chrome Web Store developer registration page”, height=“678”, width=“800” %}</p>
<p>Once you pay the registration fee and agree to the terms, you will not see this registration page again.</p>
<div class="aside aside--note">
<strong>Group publishers</strong> note that only members of the group who’ve paid the registration fee can publish updates.
