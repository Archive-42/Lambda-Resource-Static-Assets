<h1 class="title">Chrome DevTools: JavaScript CPU Profiling in Chrome 58</h1>
<p class="date">2016-12-15</p>
</header>
<p>In Chrome 58, which is currently Canary, the Timeline panel has been renamed to the Performance panel, the Profiles panel has been renamed to the Memory panel, and the Record JavaScript CPU Profile feature on the Profiles panel has been moved to a more hidden location.</p>
<p>The long-term goal is to remove the old JavaScript CPU Profiler, and get everyone working with the new workflow.</p>
<p>This little migration guide shows you how to record a JS profile in the Performance panel, and how the Performance panel’s UI maps to the old workflow that you’re used to.</p>
<h2 id="accessing-the-old-javascript-cpu-profiler-old">Accessing the old JavaScript CPU profiler {: #old }</h2>
<p>If you prefer the old “Record JavaScript CPU Profile” workflow that used to be available on the Profiles panel, you can still access it like so:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the DevTools <a href="/docs/devtools/ui#main-menu">main menu</a>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>More tools</strong> &gt; <strong>JavaScript Profiler</strong>. The old profiler opens in a new panel called <strong>JavaScript Profiler</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>{% Aside ‘warning’ %}</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The long-term goal is to migrate everyone to the new workflow. This workflow may be removed in future DevTools versions.</p>
<p>{% endAside %}</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Open DevTools.</li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Performance</strong> tab.</p>

<li><p>Record in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>To profile a page load, click <strong>Record Page Load</strong>. DevTools automatically starts the recording and then automatically stops when it detects that the page has finished loading.</li>
<li>To profile a running page, click <strong>Record</strong>, perform the actions that you want to profile, and then click <strong>Stop</strong> when you’re finished.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>From the <strong>Chart</strong> view of the old workflow, the screenshot below shows you the position of the CPU usage overview chart (top arrow) and the flame chart (bottom arrow) in the new workflow.</p>
